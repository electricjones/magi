# Contributing
Eventually some contributing information

## Stability
- `stable`: Should be good to go. Tested and verified.
- `stable-ish`: Should be good to go. Some more testing is needed to be considered production ready.
- `unstable`: A development branch. Tests should pass, but code will change and api will be unstable.
- `wip`: A development branch. Tests and builds may fail. Consider it broken.
- `broken`: I have a bad feeling about this.

## Branches
- `release`: **Stable.** - Current, up-to-date, released version. Does not necessarily mean production ready.
- `beta`: **Stable-ish.** - Next `release` version staged for final testing. Considered stable, though potentially with quirks.
- `v*.*`: **Unstable** - Version branch. Merging features in for compatibility.
- `f-{}`: **Wip** - Various features and in progress work
